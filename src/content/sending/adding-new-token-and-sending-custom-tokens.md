Adding a new token / sending custom tokens / checking balance of tokens / seeing custom token / ERC-20

### If you are not seeing your shiny new token from that token sale in your wallet, you simply need to add it to your interface.

Any ERC-20 token can be added to your local MEW interface by following these instructions.

1.  Go to [Ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io/) 
2.  Type in the name of the token, or search to your address and click on the Token's name there. 
3.  Note the address & decimals of this token.
4.  In a new tab, navigate to the ["Send Ether & Tokens](https://www.myetherwallet.com/#send-transaction)" page on MyEtherWallet.
5.  Unlock your wallet.
6.  Click "Add Custom Token" on the right side.
7.  Enter the `address` from Ethplorer.io.
8.  Type in what you want to call it - the name or the symbol.
9.  Enter the `decimals` from Ethplorer.io.
10.  Click "Save".

You can now send your new token and see it's balance in the sidebar.

In the future, we may add this token as a "Default" token on MyEtherWallet. In that case, you will see two of that token in the sidebar. While this won't break anything, it can be annoying. 

To remove a custom token, click the little ( - ) icon next to your token. This will remove it from the interface. It is not deleting or removing the tokens themselves. They are still safely in your wallet, we promise.

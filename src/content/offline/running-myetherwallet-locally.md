You can run MyEtherWallet.com on your computer instead of from the GitHub servers. You can generate a wallet completely offline and send transactions from the "Send Offline" page.

1.  Go to [https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/latest](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/latest).
2.  Click on `etherwallet-vX.X.X.X.zip`.
3.  Move zip to an airgapped computer.
4.  Unzip it and double-click `index.html`.
5.  MyEtherWallet.com is now running entirely on your computer.

In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just `index.html`. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the MyEtherWallet repo for the future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact.

As we are constantly updating MyEtherWallet.com, we recommend you periodically update your saved version of the repo.

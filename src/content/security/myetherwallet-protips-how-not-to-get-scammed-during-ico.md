### Below are some tips to reduce the risk of you losing your hard-earned coins.

<ol>
  <li id="basttrtroylyhc_l1">
    Install <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn' target='_blank'>EtherAddressLookup</a>  or <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn' target='_blank'>MetaMask</a>. These warn you if you go to a malcious website.
  </li>
  <li id="basttrtroylyhc_l2">Did you just get sent a link to a token sale, MyEtherWallet, etherdelta, Shapeshift, or Ebay? <b>Don't click it!</b> Instead, search for that service on Google. Click the top one **that is not an ad.**</li>
  <li id="basttrtroylyhc_l3">You <b>do not</b> have to enter your private key for an airdrop. Don't enter your private key on random sites!</li>
  <li id="basttrtroylyhc_l4">Double-Check the URL. Are there any weird characters? Symbols? It is <code>shapshift</code> instead of <code>shapeshift</code>? Or <code>myelherwallet</code> instead of <code>myetherwallet</code>?</li>
  <li id="basttrtroylyhc_l5">Token sale or exchange? Google the name of the token + "twitter"</li>
  <li id="basttrtroylyhc_l6">Check out the Twitter account. Everything looking good still?</li>
  <li id="basttrtroylyhc_l7">Sending to an address? Check out the address on etherscan.io.</li>
</ol>
<p id="basttrtroylyhc_p">
  The screenshots below point out specific things to check to make sure you are interacting with the correct site.
</p>


### 1. Use Google instead of clicking links sent to you
<div id="ugioclsty_img">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/XwiVCSY.jpg"/>
</div>

<p id="ugioclsty_p">
  So you received a message, saw a tweet, or whatever about hot new ICO. Don't click. Google the name of the token + "token contribution" or "ethereum" or "token".
</p>

### 2. Check the URL. Is it the same as the message received?
<div id="ctuiitsatmr_img">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/8wmJRYg.jpg" />
</div>

<p id="ctuiitsatmr_p">
  Okay....but how do I know this is the *right* URL?
</p>

### 3. Google the name of the token + "twitter"
<div id="gtnottt_img">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/cLC6kWK.jpg" />
</div>

### 4. Check out the Twitter. Everything looking good still?
<div id="cottelgs_img">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/EYwqZpL.jpg">
</div>

<p id="cottelgs_p1">
  On Twitter, check the URL and the USERNAME of the account. Be on the lookout for weird things like _ or captial-i's that look like l's or O's that look like 0's. This indicate a scammer.
</p>
<p id="cottelgs_p2">
  Followers, images, tweets and the name of the Twitter account are cloned by fake accounts. Ignore those.
</p>
<p id="cottelgs_p3">
  You have followers in common. This is a good sign! The URL they provide match the URL you were on earlier. So let's get the address.....
</p>

### 5. Check out the address on etherscan.io
<div id="cotaoei_img">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/i99arJz.jpg" />
</div>

<p id="cotaoei_p1">
  ....and let's check the comments on Etherscan.
</p>
<p id="cotaoei_p2">
  Does it have any comments? Are they all angry people who had their funds stolen?
</p>
<p id="cotaoei_p3">
  Or is there some add'l verification that this is legit? Again, never rely on a single commentâ€”this adds to the fact that all this information is consistent & correct.
</p>

### 6. And always make sure you are on the correct MyEtherWallet, too!
<div id="aamsyaotcmt_img1">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dvRFMFy.jpg" />
</div>

<p id="aamsyaotcmt_p1">
  And finally, when you go to contribute, make sure you are on a legit version of <a src="https://www.myetherwallet.com/" target="_target">MyEtherWallet.com</a>
</p>
<p id="aamsyaotcmt_p2">
  Check the URL. Check the SSL. Check the v3.9.9.5 (for district0x only). Don't rely on the version number, but its another good way to easily spot a scam site.
</p>
<p id="aamsyaotcmt_p3">
  Check the address.  Check the AddressIcon (the colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address. It is an easy way to see if the address matches across two places.)
</p>
<p id="aamsyaotcmt_p4">
  In this case, district0x's is kinda pinky-yellow and the address starts with 0xF80.
</p>
<div id="aamsyaotcmt_img2">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/1OvTydO.jpg" />
</div>

<p id="aamsyaotcmt_p5"> Sweetness. </p>

<b id="aamsyaotcmt_p6">Oh, and now the URL on MyEtherWallet displays on load & node-change. This is another easy reminder to let you know if you are on a scam site.</b>

  I’m really sorry, but it sounds like you may have been the victim of a phishing attack, malware, remote-access hack (e.g. via Teamviewer), or something similar. I cannot easily tell you how this could have happened without knowing what you do.

  Unfortunately, once a transaction is on the blockchain, it's final. We do what we can to warn others, take down the site, or whatever we can given the particular situation.

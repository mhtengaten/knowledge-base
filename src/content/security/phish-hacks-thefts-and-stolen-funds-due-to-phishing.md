Hacks, thefts, and stolen funds due to phishing links between 7/5/2017 - ??? (Slackbot Scambot phishing / Reddit DM / ???)

### I'm really sorry, but it sounds like you may have been the victim of a phishing attack, likely from a DM via Slack or Reddit.

MyEtherWallet is a client-side wallet, which means you hold your keys. If someone gets your private key (keystore file, mnemonic, passwords), they have complete access to your funds. There is no stopping transactions, canceling transactions, or resetting passwords. Once a transaction is on the blockchain, it's final.

### Document & Collect Information

1.  Look through your history for any URLs that look like MyEtherWallet.com but are actually a very similar URL (e.g. myetherwallet . su or myetherwallet . com . co).
2.  Fill out the form here: [https://etherscamdb.info/report/](https://etherscamdb.info/report/)
3.  Include your address, the URL you visited, and any additional information, including which Slack channels you were a part of or how you accessed the malicious link.

### Move your Funds ASAP & Protect Yourself Moving Forward

*   Create new accounts, safely, and move any funds from any existing accounts to these new accounts as soon as you are in a place to do so. (Rushing does not help, doing it safely is the most important thing.)
    *   [Get a Ledger or Trezor Hardware Wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html) (safest!)
    *   [Create a Cold Storage Wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/offline/running-myetherwallet-locally.html) (still really safe!)
    *   [Use MEW + MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html)
*   Never enter your private keys, passwords, sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message
*   ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction. Check your balance via [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/) or [https://ethplorer.io/](https://ethplorer.io/)
*   Do not trust messages or addresses or URLs sent via private message. Always verify information w/ a secondary source.
*   Install [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn)
*   Install [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)
*   Install [Cryptonite by Metacert](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige)
*   Install [MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet-cx/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm)

### Tokens that haven't been distributed / can't be moved yet

If you recently participated in an ICO, you may have tokens remaining in your wallet. These are not currently transferable, or perhaps these tokens will be distributed at a later date to your now compromised wallet. You will need to find out when you can send these tokens from your wallet. The easiest way to determine that is to reach out to that token's creators and ask them for the information and if they can be of further assistance. 

Once you know when you can move the tokens, you will need to plan on moving your tokens as close to that time as possible. First, send 0.01 ETH into your wallet (to cover the cost of gas) and then send your tokens out of your wallet to your new, secure wallet. You should do this as quickly as possible as soon as the tokens can be moved. 

**Lastly, read our [Getting Started Guide](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/getting-started-new.html) & ["Protecting Yourself and Your Funds"](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds.html). Be proactive about your security.**

### Again, we are really sorry.

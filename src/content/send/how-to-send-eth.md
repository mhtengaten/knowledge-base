If you plan to move a large amount of ether, you should test sending a small amount to your wallet first to ensure everything goes as planned.

1.  Navigate to the "Send Ether & Tokens" page.
2.  Select your wallet file -or- your private key and unlock your wallet.
3.  If the wallet is encrypted, a text box will automatically appear. Enter the password.
4.  Click the "Unlock Wallet" button.
5.  Enter the address you would like to send to in the "To Address:" field.
6.  Enter the amount you would like to send. You can also click the "Send Entire Balance" link if you would like the transfer the entire balance.
7.  Click "Generate Transaction".
8.  A couple more fields will appear. This is your browser generating the transaction.
9.  Click the blue "Send Transaction" button below that.
10.  A pop-up will appear. Verify that the amount and the address you are sending to are correct. Then click "Yes, I am sure! Make transaction." button.
11.  The transaction will be submitted. The TX ID will display. You can click that TX ID to see it on the blockchain.

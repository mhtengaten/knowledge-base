  I’m really sorry but MyEtherWallet is not a "web wallet". You do not create an account or give us your ETH or tokens to hold onto. We are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
</p>

<b id="wtdiysttwa_b">In order to ensure your security & privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use MyEtherWallet. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain.</b>

##### Unfortunately, this means we cannot:

<ul>
  <li id="wtdiysttwa_l1">
    Reverse or cancel transactions
  </li>
  <li id="wtdiysttwa_l2">
    Access you account
  </li>
  <li id="wtdiysttwa_l3">
    Recover your account
  </li>
  <li id="wtdiysttwa_l4">
    Send your ETH or Tokens from one address to another
  </li>
  <li id="wtdiysttwa_l5">
    Recover your private key
  </li>
  <li id="wtdiysttwa_l6">
    Recover or reset your password
  </li>
</ul>

<p id="wtdiysttwa_p2">
  If the account belongs to someone or an exchange, you should attempt to reach out to them to find out if you can recover your ETH. You can see if it is an account in use by searching it on etherscan.io and seeing if there are any other transactions to or from the account.
</p>

<p id="wtdiysttwa_p3">
  Again, I’m really sorry.

  If you plan to move a large amount of Ether or tokens, you should send a test transaction of a small amount to the destination wallet first to ensure everything goes as planned.
  Optional, but <b>highly recommended</b> (if you haven't already) Install <a href="https://kb.myetherwallet.com/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">EtherAddressLookup Chrome Extension</a> to protect yourself from malicious websites around the crypto space that will steal your private keys. Or even better, think about getting yourself a hardware wallet. You have hundreds, thousands of dollars online, you might as well spend a little bit more money to ensure that your funds are safe.

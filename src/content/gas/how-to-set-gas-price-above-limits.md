1. First, [you can follow the gif here](https://i.imgur.com/qm50zD1.gif).  

2. You can use the offline tab (you can also use it online) to manually set the gas price for a transaction. [Our guide on how to send a transaction via this tab is here](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/offline/making-offline-transaction-on-myetherwallet.html).

Please note that the TX Fee is the `gas limit * gas price`. This means that a contract transactions with a gas limit of `200000` using a gas price of `150 GWEI` would cost `0.03 ETH`, or `~$9.00 USD`.

If you are unfamiliar with how gas limit & gas price work together, [please check out our pretty rockin' guide on gas first.](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/gas/what-is-gas-ethereum.html)

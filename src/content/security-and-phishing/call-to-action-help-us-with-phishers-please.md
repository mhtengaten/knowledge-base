**These phucks will not stop until they stop getting money or get caught.** We don't have the time or manpower to do it all. There are so many things to do and watch and document. We thank you for your help.

### 1. Educate when you see a message

- If you see a link to one of these sites or a fake Token Sale address, comment on it in #general or on Twitter or on Reddit or wherever. Warn people QUICKLY & LOUDLY.

> "There are scammers that are DMing, posting links, posting comments, and trying to get you to navigate to fake URLs. DO NOT CLICK IT!" (Yes. People still don't know this. I don't know where they are, obviously not here on reddit).

> Remind people: "If it's to good to be true, it probably is."

> ⚠ PSA! Do NOT click the link or listen to the scammer! That is a phishing site. Always check your URL and/or consider getting a Ledger or TREZOR hardware wallet.

> If you have a moment, please report the recent malicious site ` myetherwallet[.]su ` as phishing to Google via [https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/) and [https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware/](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware/). If you have IE, do the same via Tools -> Report as Malicious Site so they can't trick anymore people.


### 2. Educate *before* you see a message

This is too much for one post so help spread the word: Private keys are *private*. Use hardware wallets. Use cold storage. Go offline. Check URLs.

*   [Creating a wallet offline is the shit](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-do-i-safely-slash-offline-slash-cold-storage-with-myetherwallet)

*   [Getting a](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-do-i-create-a-new-wallet) [Ledger or Trezor Hardware Wallet](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/hardware-wallet-recommends) is even better.

*   [You can sign transactions offline so your key never touches a phishing site!](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-do-i-make-an-offline-transaction)

- Install EAL to block malicious / phishing sites: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn)

*   [Install the MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet-cx/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm)

- Install MetaMask to block malicious / phishing sites & interact with MEW: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)

*   Never enter your private keys, passwords, sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message

*   ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction. Check your balance via [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/) or [https://ethplorer.io/](https://ethplorer.io/)

*   Do not trust messages or addresses or URLs sent via private message. Always verify information w/ a secondary source.

*   [Protips: How not to get scammed](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/pro-tips-how-not-to-get-scammed-during-a-token-sale) *(needs cleanup and to be more generic)*

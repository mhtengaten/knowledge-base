MyEtherWallet gives you the ability to generate new wallets so you can store your ETH &amp; Tokens yourself, not on an exchange. This process happens entirely on your computer, not our servers. We are not a web wallet. We are a client-side interface that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. We never save, store, or transmit any sensitive information ever. Therefore, when you generate a new wallet, you are responsible for safely backing it up.

In order to get started:

1. [Create a new wallet.](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/creating-a-new-wallet-on-myetherwallet.html)

2. [Back up the wallet.](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/backing-up-your-new-wallet.html)

3. [Verify you have access to this new wallet.](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/accessing-your-new-eth-wallet.html)

4. [Transfer ETH / Tokens to this new wallet.](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/faq/buying-selling-exchanging-eth-tokens-fiat.html)

5. [Check your Balance](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/checking-balance-of-my-account.html)

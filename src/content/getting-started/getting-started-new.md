  What is MEW?
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="whatIsMew_1">  MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface.  </li>
<li id="whatIsMew_2">  We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys & your funds.  </li>
<li id="whatIsMew_3">  You and only you are responsible for your security.  </li>
<li id="whatIsMew_4">  We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your private key. </li>

  MyEtherWallet is not a Bank
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="mewNotABank_1">  When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system.  </li>
<li id="mewNotABank_2">  The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.  </li>
<li id="mewNotABank_3">  The bank charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.  </li>
<li id="mewNotABank_4">  The bank allows you to write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.  </li>
<li id="mewNotABank_5">  You have an account with the bank or exchange and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.  </li>

<h3 id="mewIsAnInterface">
  MyEtherWallet is an Interface
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="mewIsAnInterface_1">  When you create an account on MyEtherWallet you are generating a cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).  </li>
<li id="mewIsAnInterface_2">  The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.  </li>
<li id="mewIsAnInterface_3">  We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.  </li>
<li id="mewIsAnInterface_4">  We do not charge a transaction fee.  </li>
<li id="mewIsAnInterface_5">  You are simply using our interface to interact directly with the blockchain.  </li>
<li id="mewIsAnInterface_6">  If you send your public key (address) to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. üëç  </li>
<li id="mewIsAnInterface_7">  If you send your private key to someone, they now have full control of your account. üëé  </li>

<h3 id="wtfBlockchain">
  Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="wtfBlockchain_1">  The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.  </li>
<li id="wtfBlockchain_2">  It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is.  </li>
<li id="wtfBlockchain_3">  It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.  </li>
<li id="wtfBlockchain_4">  The blocks in the blockchain are made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else.  </li>
<li id="wtfBlockchain_5">  When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on etherscan.io, you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems.  </li>
<li id="wtfBlockchain_6">  Again: we are not a bank  </li>

<h3 id="mewCantDo">
  If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point?
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="mewCantDo_1">  Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.  </li>
<li id="mewCantDo_2">  You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.  </li>
<li id="mewCantDo_3">  You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.  </li>
<li id="mewCantDo_4">  If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. üòâ  </li>
<li id="mewCantDo_5">  If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames &amp; passwords.  </li>
<li id="mewCantDo_6">  If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure.  </li>

  How To Protect Yourself from Phishers
</h3>

<p id="howToProtectYourselfFromPhishing_1">
Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromPhishing_2">  Use the [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html) Chrome Extension to block malicious websites.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromPhishing_3">  Always check the URL: `https://www.myetherwallet.com`.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromPhishing_4">  Always make sure the URL bar has `MYETHERWALLET Inc [US]` in green.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromPhishing_5">  Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromPhishing_6">  Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromPhishing_7">  [Install an AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).  </li>

<p id="howToProtectYourselfFromScam_1">People will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing.</p>

<ul>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromScam_2">  If it is too good to be true, it probably is.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromScam_3">  Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromScam_4">  Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromScam_5">  Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself "why?". It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.  </li>

</h3>

<p id="howToProtectYourselfFromLoss_1">If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it. </p>

<ul>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromLoss_2">  Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromLoss_3">  Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromLoss_4">  Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.  </li>
<li id="howToProtectYourselfFromLoss_5">  If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.  </li>

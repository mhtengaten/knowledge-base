  What is MEW?
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface.  </li>
<li>  We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys &amp; your funds.  </li>
<li>  **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  MyEtherWallet is not a Bank
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  When you open a bank account, a banker creates an account for you in their system.  </li>
<li>  The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.  </li>
<li>  They charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.  </li>
<li>  You can write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.  </li>
<li>  You have an account *with the bank* and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  MyEtherWallet is an Interface
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  When you create an account here, you are generating an cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).  </li>
<li>  If you send your *public key (address)* to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. üëç  </li>
<li>  If you send your *private key* to someone, they now have full control of your account. üëé  </li>
<li>  The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.  </li>
<li>  We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.  </li>
<li>  We do not charge a transaction fee.  </li>
<li>  You are just using our **interface** to interact **directly with the blockchain**.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.  </li>
<li>  It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is.  </li>
<li>  It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.  </li>
<li>  It is made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else.  </li>
<li>  When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io), you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems.  </li>
<li>  Again: **we are not a bank**.  </li>

<h3>
  We need you to understand that we **cannot**...
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  Access your account or send your funds for you  </li>
<li>  Recover or change your private key  </li>
<li>  Recover or reset your password  </li>
<li>  Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions  </li>
<li>  Freeze accounts  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security.
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file,  wallet file.  </li>
<li>  If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it.  </li>
<li>  If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have **all your funds taken**.  </li>

<h3>
  If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point?
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.  </li>
<li>  You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.  </li>
<li>  You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.  </li>
<li>  If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. üòâ  </li>
<li>  If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames &amp; passwords.  </li>
<li>  If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure.  </li>

<h3>
  How To Protect Yourself from Phishers
</h3>

Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

<ul>
<li>  Use the [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html) Chrome Extension to block malicious websites.  </li>
<li>  Always check the URL: `https://www.myetherwallet.com`.  </li>
<li>  Always make sure the URL bar has `MYETHERWALLET LLC [US]` in green.  </li>
<li>  Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.  </li>
<li>  Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.  </li>
<li>  [Install an AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).  </li>

<h3>
  How To Protect Yourself from Scams
</h3>

People will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing.

<ul>
<li>  If it is too good to be true, it probably is.  </li>
<li>  Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.  </li>
<li>  Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.  </li>
<li>  Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself 'why?'. It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  How To Protect Yourself from Loss
</h3>

If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it.

<ul>
<li>  Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.  </li>
<li>  Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.  </li>
<li>  Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.  </li>
<li>  If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.  </li>
<li>  Make sure you have **external backups**. Chrome Extensions are not 100% reliable. Many things could happen that would cause loss, including uninstalling the extension. This is an easy way to access your wallets, **not** a way to back them up.  </li>
</ul>

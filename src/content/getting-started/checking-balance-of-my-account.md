<p id="ctboya_p1"> You only need your <b>public wallet address</b> in order to see your balance. It is not recommended that you access your wallet by entering your private key anywhere if you just want to check the balance or see incoming or outgoing transactions. The fewer times that you need to open your wallet, the better. </p>

You only need your **public wallet address** in order to see your balance. It is not recommended that you access your wallet by entering your private key anywhere if you just want to check the balance or see incoming or outgoing transactions. The fewer times that you need to open your wallet, the better.

### Ethereum

[https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/). Paste your address into the search bar and it will pull up your address and transaction history.

### Tokens

[https://ethplorer.io/](https://ethplorer.io/) allows you to easily see token balances and transfers.

You can also see all tokens on https://etherscan.io/ now. Your balances are in the dropdown in the header section thingy. Your transfers can be viewed on the ["Token Transfers"](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7cb57b5a97eabe94205c07890be4c1ad31e486a8#tokentxns) tab.

### Ethereum Classic

[https://gastracker.io/](https://gastracker.io/). Paste your address into the search bar and it will pull up your address and transaction history.

### MyEtherWallet

You can also enter your address on MyEtherWallet's [View Wallet Info](https://www.myetherwallet.com/#view-wallet-info) page by selecting the "View With Address Only" option at the bottom. Note: This only allows your to **view** your balances, **NOT** access you wallet to send funds. Remember, you must have the private key in order to access your account.

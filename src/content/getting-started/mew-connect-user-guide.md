			<p>Step 2. Click "Create New Wallet"</p>
      <p> Step 3. Pick a strong password.</p>

      This step is very important. Make sure you pick a password that
      is not easy to guess, but also write it down with pen and paper.
      If you forget it, we cannot recover it for you. There is only one other way to recover a wallet, and we’ll get to that soon.

      <p>Step 4. Type it again.</p>
      <p>Step 5. Click "Start using MEWconnect"</p>
      <p>
        You’re done! You’ll be taken to a screen that shows your new wallets address backed by a unique color-code. On this screen you’ll find all your ETH and tokens. There is also a handy ‘Share’ button next to your address, in case you want to send it to someone.

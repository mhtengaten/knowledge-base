### 1. Welcome to MyEtherWallet.com
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-01.svg)
- Please take some time to read &amp; understand this for your own safety. üôè
- Your funds will be stolen if you do not head these warnings.
- We know this click-through shit is annoying. We are sorry.
- Even if you have been around for a while, perhaps you will learn something new, or can use this information to help others be safer.

##### What is MEW?
- MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface.
- We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys &amp; your funds.
- **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security.

### 2. MyEtherWallet is not a Bank
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-02.svg)
- When you open a bank account, a banker creates an account for you in their system.
- The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.
- They charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.
- You can write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.
- You have an account *with the bank* and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.

### 3. MyEtherWallet is an Interface
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-03.svg)
- When you create an account here, you are generating an cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).
- If you send your *public key (address)* to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. üëç
- If you send your *private key* to someone, they now have full control of your account. üëé
- The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.
- We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.
- We do not charge a transaction fee.
- You are just using our **interface** to interact **directly with the blockchain**.

### 4. Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-04.svg)
- The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.
- It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is.
- It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.
- It is made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else.
- When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io), you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems.
- Again: <strong>we are not a bank</strong>.

### 5. Why are you making me read all this?
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-05.svg)

##### Because we need you to understand that we **cannot**...
- Access your account or send your funds for you
- Recover or change your private key
- Recover or reset your password
- Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions
- Freeze accounts

##### **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security.
- Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file,  wallet file.
- If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it.
- If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have **all your funds taken**.

### 6. If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point?
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-06.svg)
- Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.
- You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.
- You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.
- If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. üòâ
- If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames &amp; passwords.
- If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure.

### 7. How To Protect Yourself from Phishers
Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-07.svg)
- Use the [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html) Chrome Extension to block malicious websites.
- Always check the URL: `https://www.myetherwallet.com`.
- Always make sure the URL bar has `MYETHERWALLET LLC [US]` in green.
- Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
- Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.
- [Install an AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).

### 8. How To Protect Yourself from Scams
People will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing.
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-08.svg)
- If it is too good to be true, it probably is.
- Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.
- Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.
- Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself 'why?'. It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.

### 9. How To Protect Yourself from Loss
If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it.
![](https://www.myetherwallet.com/images/onboarding_icon-09.svg)
- Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.
- Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.
- Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.
- If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.
- Make sure you have **external backups**. Chrome Extensions are not 100% reliable. Many things could happen that would cause loss, including uninstalling the extension. This is an easy way to access your wallets, **not** a way to back them up.

### What Is An ICO?

ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, also known as “token sale” or crowdsale. It is an unregulated fundraising method for startups. Start-up companies use these funds to further develop and complete their blockchain based software projects. It is similar to IPO ( Initial Public Offering), in which investors purchase shares of a company. 

Initial Coin Offerings offer “Tokens” in return for users who support them by sending them Ether. When you give these ICO teams your ETH/BTC or other currencies, it means that you believe that these technologies that they are creating will bring value to the entirety of the Ethereum Community. 

In the beginning of an ICO, the leading team will explain their vision and normally provide a White Paper. This White Paper contains a lot of valuable information that you should read, even if you do not understand a lot of technical terms, as long as your get a basic understanding of what the Token is about, it will help in your decision making. 

Take note of the team and web developers behind the ICO. Reputable programmers and business people usually mean that the ICO is legitimate and that it has a lot of potential. Sometimes, these teams recruit well known Facebook developers or managers/Google employees, this is when you know that the Token Team is truly creating something valuable. 

It it crucial to do your research on an ICO that you are interested in. This ICO hype in the community has caused many people and fake companies to create “Scam ICOS” simply because it is easy to raise money due to creating “hype” around the token. Scam ICOs usually execute the “pump and dump” method for gaining maximum profits. 

Pump and Dump (when a token hits exchanges): When a token is full of hype and no backbone or actual real world value, a lot of people will ride the hype wave up. Everyone will see that the token is performing exceptionally well on exchanges and buy in, but there are people who are ready to dump massive amounts of the token back into the exchanges (Hundreds of Thousands of dollars worth of the token, sometimes millions of dollars worth). Selling massive amount of tokens causes the price to plummet, and then everyone else starts to panic and they sell off to cut of loses. 

There are many successful and truly valuable technologies and concepts that have come out of ICOs, and that is a good thing. But you must always remain vigilant and do a lot of research before investing in anything. 

After doing your own research and making a decision that a token is worth investing in the next steps are to buy into the ICO.

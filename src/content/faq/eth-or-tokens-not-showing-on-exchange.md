First, check the transaction on [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/) and ensure that there is no red ( ! ) symbol by the transaction.

A successful transaction will look like this: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcde5a30a1a1514919e9c357d4e89211701aa22a741936ad9516c2987d8b097c9](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcde5a30a1a1514919e9c357d4e89211701aa22a741936ad9516c2987d8b097c9)

And unsuccessful one will look like this: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9c8514fad47eb54a414930563aabfeceb465c9f308f5f294a37edd0d669243c](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9c8514fad47eb54a414930563aabfeceb465c9f308f5f294a37edd0d669243c)

If there is no red symbol, that means the transaction is a valid & successful transaction on the blockchain.

MyEtherWallet is not a "web-wallet" and we do not store your funds and you do not have an account with us. We do not have the ability to process withdrawals nor deposits, nor can we send or cancel transactions. If your funds aren't showing up where you sent them, you likely need to reach out to that service and for more information.

We also highly recommend that you Google the services you send funds to as there are a lot of scams out there. Typing in "[service name] + scam" or  "[service name] + reviews" will help you determine if you are sending to a legitimate service.

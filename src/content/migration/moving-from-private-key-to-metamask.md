### Installing MetaMask

1. First of all, install the MetaMask extension for your browser.

    **If you use Google Chrome, you can [install MetaMask from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).**

    **If you use Firefox, you can [install MetaMask from the Mozilla Add-ons collection](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/).**

    Otherwise, we strongly encourage you to install Chrome or Firefox. This is because certain parts of MyEtherWallet may not even work without one of those browsers.

### Configuring MetaMask

2. Accept the terms of use by scrolling all the way down and continue creating your new MetaMask wallet.
3. You are now asked to enter a password, which will be required every time you want to interact with the Ethereum network. It is comparable to the password of a keystore file. Please choose a strong password (at least 8 characters, include at least one symbol).

4. You are now shown 12 words. This is your mnemonic, and it's the only way to recover your Ethereum after your pc crashed. You can write or down and store it in a safe, or engrave it in metal (see [Cryptosteel](https://cryptosteel.com/)). This will make sure that it never gets lost, even if your house catches fire.

### Transferring your funds

5. You should now be shown a menu with your account, balance, and transaction history. To transfer your funds from your old account to your newly setup MetaMask wallet, head to MyEtherWallet.
6. Unlock your account with your mnemonic or private key, and you will be greeted by the familiar send ether & tokens menu. To find out the address of your MetaMask wallet, you can press the three dots in the menu (...) and click `Copy Address to clipboard`. 7. Paste the address in MyEtherWallet, and transfer all tokens & ether to your MetaMask address (ctrl + v to paste).

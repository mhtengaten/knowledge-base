_"How do I swap my ETH for BTC or BTC for ETH?"_

* Go to the Swap page: <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/#swap" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/#swap">https://www.myetherwallet.com/#swap</a>
* Enter the amount of ETH / BTC / REP you would like to exchange.
* Click the "Let's do this!" button.
* Enter your receiving ETH or BTC address.
* If _sending_ BTC, you will see an address and a QR code to send to. Open up your bitcoin wallet and send that EXACT amount of BTC from the wallet.

Please be sure to send a high enough TX fee to have it processed quickly.

Please be sure to send the correct amount of BTC in _addition_ to the TX fee. This means that a slightly larger amount should leave your address than what you sent.

* If sending ETH, unlock your wallet and send the transaction.
* The ETH or BTC will show up in the address you entered in Step #4.

_"I sent ETC to my ETH wallet by mistake"._

### How To

In order to see your ETC and interact with the ETC chain, you must first be on an ETC node.

1. Select "ETC (Epool.io)" in the network-switcher in the top-right corner of [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

2. Unlock your wallet to send ETC to interact with the ETC chain.

3. You can see your ETC balance by clicking the "View Wallet Info" page in the navigation and selected -> "View with Address Only". You can also [check your balance](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/checking-balance-of-my-account.html) on a blockchain explorer.

In order to switch back to ETH, simply change the node back to an ETH node in the upper right corner.

### When it involves a Hardware Wallet...

1. Select "ETC (Epool.io)" in the network-switcher in the top-right corner of [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

2. Connect to your hardware wallet like normal

3. Check the "path" at the top of the pop-up. Change it to `TREZOR (ETH)` or `LEDGER (ETH)`

4. Look for your balance and select the address where your ETH or ETC are.

There are four possible combinations of network + path when it comes to hardware wallets. If the above doesn't show your balance, try all four:

- ETH Network, ETH path

- ETH Network, ETC path

- ETC Network, ETH path

- ETC Network, ETC path

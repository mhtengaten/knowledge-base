A combination of new users, increased interest, CryptoKitties, and misc. ICOs have created quite a mess of the TX pool and has a lot of TXs pending and taking longer than normal to send. This is a network issue and affecting all exchanges and clients.

There is simply not enough space in the blocks for the miners to mine all the transactions, and most systems are not currently set up to monitor the massive quantity of transaction requests. This is affecting all people's ability to send transactions, including our own.

### Helpful Tools and Resources to Get Your TX to Send

*  [See all the transactions that are pending here](https://etherscan.io/txsPending)

*  [Learn about **Gas**, **TX Fees**, and how to get your TX to go thru](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/gas/what-is-gas-ethereum.html) 

*  [Replace a **pending TX** that you sent with too low gas](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/transactions/check-status-of-ethereum-transaction.html)

*  [See what the **optimal gas price** is here (at 12/07/2017 @ 12:00am PT it was **61** GWEI)](https://ethgasstation.info/)            

*  [Learn about **Nonce** and how it controls which transactions are mined, or not mined](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/transactions/what-is-nonce.html)
            

### Other Tips

*  Try switching the network in the upper left to use a different node. There are 4 nodes that allow you to interact with ETH: MyEtherWallet, Etherscan, Infura, and Giveth. If one is not working, simply choose another one.

*  If you get a transaction hash for your transaction but it isn't showing up on Etherscan, you can check & replace the transaction with one with a higher gas price here: https://www.myetherwallet.com/#check-tx-status 

*  If you sent **FROM an exchange**, your best bet is to just be patient. I know we received over 1000 messages in the past 24 hours, I can't imagine what an exchange's inbox looks like right now. :(

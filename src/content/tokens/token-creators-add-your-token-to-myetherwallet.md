#### [If you are a person experimenting with tokens, you can add a token to your local version of MyEtherWallet](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/send/adding-new-token-and-sending-custom-tokens.html)

### If you have a token that other people also have, or will have in the coming days, you can add it to our site. You will need to provide:

*   **Name** of your token
*   **Symbol** of your token
*   **Address** of your token
*   **Decimals** of your token
*   **Your official Website**
*   **Your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">direct</span>Â customer support email**
    *   Due to high numbers of token sale holders NOT providing support to their investors, we will remove your token if you do not help the people who made you millionaires.
*  Optionally, you may also include your blog, social media sites, chat channels, your logo, etc.

### 1. Submit your Tokens as Default Tokens

*   Go to [https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/blob/master/tokens/tokens-eth.json](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/blob/master/tokens/tokens-eth.json)
    *   *If your token exists on a different network, [you can add them here](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/tree/master/tokens)
*   Login or join Github
*   Click the pencil icon in upper right
*   Scroll to the letter of your token (they are in alpha order)
*   Copy an existing token starting at the `{` and ending with `},`
*   Remove any information that you copied that isn't yours
*   Add your address, decimals, name, and symbol
*   Add your website
*   Add your support email
*   Add any other additional links

### 2. Add your token sale address & manual gas limits to ensure a smooth sale

*   Go here [https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/blob/mercury/app/scripts/customGas.js](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/blob/mercury/app/scripts/customGas.js)

*   Replace the information with your information:
*   Address: The address users will be sending to
*   Gas Limit: The gas limit you are recommending that ensures there will be no Out of Gas errors
*   Data: Optional. If there is a standard data field, add that string
*   Message: Optional. If people need to generate data, include a note here to remind them. You can include the block start times or date and what token sale it is for
*   At the bottom under "Commit changes" type "Manual gas limits for upcoming _____ token" in the title box
*   Any other notes you would like us to see can be included below.

We now provide users with the ability to enter the address and it auto-populate with the ABI. If you have a contract that IS NOT YOUR ERC-20 TOKEN CONTRACT that users WILL ACTUALLY BE interacting with:

*   [https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/blob/mercury/app/scripts/abiDefinitions/ethAbi.json](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/blob/mercury/app/scripts/abiDefinitions/ethAbi.json)
*   Copy from `{` to `},`

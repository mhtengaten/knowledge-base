If one of your first questions is "Why should I trust these people?", that is a good thing.

Hopefully the following will help ease your fears.

*   We aren't going to take your money or steal your private key(s). There is no malicious code on this site. In fact the Generate page are completely client-side. That means that all the code is executed on <span>your computer</span> and it is never saved and transmitted anywhere.
*   We've been up and running since August 2015\. You can Google us and look for yourself.
*   Generate a test wallet and check and see what network activity is happening. The easiest way for you to do this is to right click on the page and click "inspect element". Go to the "Network" tab. Generate a test wallet. You will see there is no network activity. You may see something happening that looks like data:image/gif and data:image/png. Those are the QR codes being generated...on your computer...by your computer. No bytes were transferred.
*   If you do not feel comfortable using this tool, then by all means, do not use it. We created this tool as a helpful way for people to generate wallets and make transactions without needing to dive into command line or run a full node.

**But the biggest reason: You don't have to trust us. **

*   These ensure that your keys never touch an internet connected device which means we couldn't steal them even if we wanted to.

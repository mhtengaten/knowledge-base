Title: Statement regarding the Slackbot Phishing attacks
*/

### Regarding today's widespread slackbot phishing attacks

If you had your funds stolen, please send:

1. The website. URLs, websites, malicious links, etc. So far its all been myetherwallet . su and .com .co *(please do not post linkable links in public, e.g. on Twitter / Facebook / Slack / Reddit -- always add spaces)*

2. **Your** address - the ones the funds were stolen **from**

3. The address(es) the stolen funds were sent **to**

4. Which slack channels you are part of / that you received a DM at.

**Confirmed** accounts that were stolen **from** is very helpful. We find that a lot of these attackers filter funds through other compromised ("victim") accounts so we must be careful before assuming that an address that received stolen funds is an "attacker's" address. This is also why having a more comprehensive list of accounts that were stolen from is helpful. If you ever decide to go down a rabbit hole to chase "attackers", be mindful of this and try not to start a witchhunt

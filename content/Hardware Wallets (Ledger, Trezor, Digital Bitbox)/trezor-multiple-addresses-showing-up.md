"Multiple Addresses Showing on TREZOR...Which One Should I Use?"

Ledger has a number of addresses on it already with their private keys stored on the Ledger. Hence I'm afraid you have to use one of those addresses to transfer your tokens to. When you connect your Ledger to MEW you'll see a number of them, just choose one you want to use and send your coins there.

Just to be clear, you don't need to setup a new wallet, they already exist on the Ledger. You just use MEW as an interface to it.

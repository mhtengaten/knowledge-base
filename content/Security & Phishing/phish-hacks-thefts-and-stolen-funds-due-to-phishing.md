Hacks, thefts, and stolen funds due to phishing links between 7/5/2017 - ??? (Slackbot Scambot phishing / Reddit DM / ???)

### I'm really sorry, but it sounds like you may have been the victim of a phishing attack, likely from a DM via Slack or Reddit.

MyEtherWallet is a client-side wallet, which means you hold your keys. If someone gets your private key (keystore file, mnemonic, passwords), they have complete access to your funds. There is no stopping transactions, canceling transactions, or resetting passwords. Once a transaction is on the blockchain, it's final.

We are actively attempting to track down the people behind these sites and do what we can to warn others, take down the site, and work with exchanges to see if the funds could be frozen, recovered, or identities of attackers known.

### Help Us Document & Collect Information

1.  Look through your history for any URLs that look like MyEtherWallet.com but are actually a very similar URL (e.g. myetherwallet . su or myetherwallet . com . co).
2.  Fill out the form here: [https://etherscamdb.info/report/](https://etherscamdb.info/report/)
3.  Include your address, the URL you visited, and any additional information, including which Slack channels you were a part of or how you accessed the malicious link.
4.  Include a screenshot, if available, of the message sent. You can upload the screenshot to imgur and include it as a link with your add'l details.

We are working with exchanges & lawyers to provide lists of accounts & domains, so your address and any information you share with us is extremely helpful as we document, share, and attempt to take action against these scumbags.

### Move your Funds ASAP & Protect Yourself Moving Forward

*   Create new accounts, safely, and move any funds from any existing accounts to these new accounts as soon as you are in a place to do so. (Rushing does not help, doing it safely is the most important thing.)

I’m really sorry, but it sounds like you may have been the victim of a phishing attack, malware, remote-access hack (e.g. via Teamviewer), or something similar. I cannot easily tell you how this could have happened without knowing what you do.

Unfortunately, once a transaction is on the blockchain, it's final. We do what we can to warn others, take down the site, or whatever we can given the particular situation.

### In order to prevent this from happening in the future please:

0. [Read: Protecting yourself and your funds](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds)
1.  Bookmark [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)  and only access the site via your own bookmark.
3. Get a [Ledger or Trezor](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/hardware-wallet-recommends) -or- create a [new, secure wallet](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-do-i-create-a-new-wallet) & back it up offline.
4.  Move all funds from all accounts you have to this new, secure account as soon as possible.

### In order to help us determine how this happened:

1. Send us the URL(s) you accessed, or Ethereum-related applications you may have downloaded.
2. Send us any malicious websites or applications you visited or downloaded. We send takedown requests and warn others.
3. Post a comment on all the addresses that your ETH was moved to on https://etherscan.io/ saying that this account robbed you. This will help others know that this person is a thief in the future.

Again, I'm really sorry.

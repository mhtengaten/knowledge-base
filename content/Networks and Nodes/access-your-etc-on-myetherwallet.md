*I sent ETC to my ETH wallet by mistake.*

### How-to

In order to see your ETC and interact with the ETC chain, you must first be on an ETC node.

1. Select "ETC (Epool.io)" in the network-switcher in the top-right corner of [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

2. Unlock your wallet to send ETC, or otherwise interact with the ETC chain.

3. You can see your ETC balance by clicking the "View Wallet Info" page in the navigation and selected -> "View with Address Only". You can also [check your balance](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-do-i-check-the-balance-of-my-account) on a blockchain explorer.

In order to switch back to ETH, simply change the node back to an ETH node in the upper right.

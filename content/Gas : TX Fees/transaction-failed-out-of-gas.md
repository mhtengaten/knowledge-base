Title: Transaction Failed - "Out of Gas"
Sort: 2
*/

<p>Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) require gas and that gas is paid in Ether. You can think of this like a transaction fee. The more computational effort a transaction takes, the more gas you need.</p>
<p>MyEtherWallet estimates how much gas you will need - but sometimes it doesn't get it right.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:&nbsp;Try manually increasing the "Gas Limit". First, try doubling the amount of gas that MyEtherWallet estimates, and sending again. </strong></p>
<p>Any excess gas will be returned to you, so you could even triple or quadruple it.</p>
<p><span>We are always trying to improve how we estimate gas as contracts become more complex. However, sometimes we still get it wrong. We apologize for the inconvenience.&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>A standard TX will be 21000 gas &amp; a gas price of 0.00000002 ETH so the total TX fee will be 0.00042 Ether. </span></li>
<li><span>With tokens, the amount of gas is typically 50000 gas - 100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.</span></li>
<li>The amount of ETH or tokens you are sending <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span>&nbsp;affect the amount of gas you need.</li>
<li><span><em>GAS LIMIT</em> is the maximum amount of GAS you will send with your transaction. This is in units of GAS.</span></li>
<li><span><em>GAS PRICE</em>, which you will not see except on the Offline page, is how much each unit of gas costs. We set it at&nbsp;0.00000002 ETH.</span></li>

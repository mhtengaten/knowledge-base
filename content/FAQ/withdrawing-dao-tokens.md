###You need to run the older version of MyEtherWallet (v3.3.7) to access the old DAO pages:

*   [https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/tag/v3.3.7](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/tag/v3.3.7) 
*   Click on `dist-v3.3.7.zip`
*   Unzip it
*   Double-click `index.html`
*   MyEtherWallet is now running entirely on your computer

In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just `index.html`. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder.

### Once you've got the site up:

*  Click the **Withdraw DAO page** in the footer
*  You will see three tabs:
	*  1 for withdrawing ETH
	*  1 for withdrawing ETC
	*  1 for withdrawing your ExtraBalance
*  Click the three red buttons on the three DAO tabs to withdraw.
*  Done!

**Note: You will need minimum 0.01 ETH and 0.01 ETC in order to cover the cost of gas necessary to process the withdrawals.**

Decrypting the keystore files is an intensive process and doesn't enjoy being done in Javascript. We recommend...

1.  Using Google Chrome
2.  Clicking "continue" when you see the unresponsive error alert pop up
3.  Making sure you don't have other intensive programs open (a lot of browser tabs, video games, etc.)

The combination of the above typically eliminate the problem. If it doesn't, please contact us with your browser and OS and we can advise from there.

<p>You can run MyEtherWallet.com on your computer instead of from the GitHub servers. You can generate a wallet completely offline and send transactions from the "Send Offline" page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/latest" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/latest</a>.</li>
<li>Click on <code>etherwallet-vX.X.X.X.zip</code>.</li>
<li>Move zip to an airgapped computer.</li>
<li>Unzip it and double-click <code>index.html</code>.</li>
<li>MyEtherWallet.com is now running entirely on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just <code>index.html</code>. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the MyEtherWallet repo for the future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact.</p>
<p>As we are constantly updating MyEtherWallet.com, we recommend you periodically update your saved version of the repo.</p>

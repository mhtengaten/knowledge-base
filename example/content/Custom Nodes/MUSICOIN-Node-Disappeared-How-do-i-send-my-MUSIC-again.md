"MUSICOIN Node Disappeared. How do I send my MUSIC again?"

We temporarily removed the MUSIC node as we had some issues with hardware wallets and lack of EIP-155 support. 

You can still add it as custom by following these instructions though:

1. Select custom at the very bottom of the network dropdown in top right
2. NAME: MUSICOIN
3. URL: https://mewapi.musicoin.tw or https://mcdnode.trustfarm.io/api
4. PORT: (leave it blank)
5. Select "CUSTOM"
6. Leave EIP-155 unchecked.
7. Click "Save & Use Custom Node" button. 

You should see a purple bar at the bottom telling you are successfully connected. If the bar is red, remove the node by clicking the little ( X ) icon next to the MUISCOIN name in the network dropdown and try the other URL (above)

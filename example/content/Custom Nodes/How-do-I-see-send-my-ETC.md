### How do I access my ETC on MyEtherWallet?

In order to see your ETC and interact with the ETC chain, you must first be on an ETC node. 

Select "ETC (Epool.io)" in the node switcher in the upper right corner of [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

Then you can unlock any wallet send a transaction in ETC, or see your ETC balance by clicking the "View Wallet Info" page -> "View with Address Only"

In order to switch back to ETH, simply change the node back to an ETH node in the upper right. 

You can also [check your balance](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-do-i-check-the-balance-of-my-account) on a blockchain explorer.

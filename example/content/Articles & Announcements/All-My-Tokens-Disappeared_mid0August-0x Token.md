### Where did all my toks go?

We have temporarily disabled viewing all tokens by default due to the servers being overloaded because people were using MEW to check token balances and somehow managed to check 4M balances in like15 minutes which is nutty and expensive. 

If you need to check other token balances: you can add custom token or wait a few hours until we bring them back.

If you were having issues loading all balances: this should be resolved, or try a differnt network (etherscan / infura) via the dropdown in top-right corner

### Ledger / HW / Mnemonic Issues

We've confirmed that these are result of something in Chrome 60. If you are having trouble, try a newer dev build, e.g. v62: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html

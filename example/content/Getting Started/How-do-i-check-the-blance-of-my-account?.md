You only need your **address** in order to see your balance. It is not recommended that you enter your private key anywhere if you just want to check on the balance or see incoming / outgoing transactions. 

#### ETH

[https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/). Paste your address into the search bar and it will pull up your address and transaction history.

#### Tokens

[https://ethplorer.io/](https://ethplorer.io/) allows you to easily see token balances and transfers.

You can also see all tokens on https://etherscan.io/ now. Your balances are in the dropdown in the header section thingy. Your transfers can be viewed on the ["Token Transfers"](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7cb57b5a97eabe94205c07890be4c1ad31e486a8#tokentxns) tab.

#### ETC

[https://gastracker.io/](https://gastracker.io/). Paste your address into the search bar and it will pull up your address and transaction history.

#### MEW

You can also enter your address only on the [View Wallet Info](https://www.myetherwallet.com/#view-wallet-info) page by selecting the "View With Address Only" option at the bottom. Note: This **does not** mean that you can transfer those. Remember, you must have the private key in order to access your account.

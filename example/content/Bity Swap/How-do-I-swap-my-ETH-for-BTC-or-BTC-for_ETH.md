"How do I swap my ETH for BTC or BTC for ETH?"
<ol>
<li>Go to the Swap page:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/#swap" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/#swap">https://www.myetherwallet.com/#swap</a></li>
<li>Enter the amount of ETH or BTC you would like to exchange</li>
<li>Click the "Let's do this!" button.</li>
<li>Enter your receiving ETH or BTC address.</li>
<li>If&nbsp;<em>sending</em>&nbsp;BTC, you will see an address + QR code to send to. Open up your BTC wallet and send that EXACT amount of BTC from the wallet.
<ul>
<li>Please be sure to send a high enough TX fee to have it processed quickly.</li>
<li>Please be sure to send the correct amount of BTC in&nbsp;<em>addition</em>&nbsp;to the TX fee. This means that a slightly larger amount should leave your address than what you sent.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If sending ETH, unlock your wallet and send the transaction.</li>
<li>The ETH or BTC will show up in the address you entered in Step #4.</li>

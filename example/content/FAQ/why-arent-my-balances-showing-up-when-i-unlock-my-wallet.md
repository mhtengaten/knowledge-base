Title: Why aren't my balances showing up when I unlock my wallet?
Sort: 2

<div>
<p class="ng-scope">This is most likely due to the fact that you are behind a firewall. The API that we use to get the balance and convert said balance is often blocked by firewalls for whatever reason. You will still be able to send transactions, you just need to use a different method to see said balance, like etherscan.io</p>

*/

<p><strong>You need to run the older version of MyEtherWallet (v3.3.7) to access the old DAO pages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/tag/v3.3.7" data-cke-saved-href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/tag/v3.3.7">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/tag/v3.3.7</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Click on&nbsp;dist-v3.3.7.zip</li>
<li>Unzip it</li>
<li>Double-click&nbsp;index.html</li>
<li>MyEtherWallet is now running entirely on your computer</li>
</ul>
<p>(In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just&nbsp;index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Etherscan.io has also been kind enough to host this older version of MyEtherWallet on their site here:&nbsp;<a href="https://etherscan.io/myetherwallet/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://etherscan.io/myetherwallet/">https://etherscan.io/myetherwallet/</a></strong><br /><br /><span>Once you've got the site up, click the</span><strong>&nbsp;Withdraw DAO page</strong><span>&nbsp;in the footer. You will see three tabs: 1 for withdrawing ETH, 1 for withdrawing ETC, and 1 for withdrawing your ExtraBalance.</span><br /><br /><span>Then you can click the three red buttons on the three DAO tabs to withdraw. You will need minimum 0.01 ETH and 0.01 ETC in order to cover the cost of gas necessary to process the withdrawals.&nbsp;</span></p>

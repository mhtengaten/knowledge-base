Title: [WIP] Should I create a new address for each token I hold?

The choice is yours. Your address can hold ETH & any ERC-20 tokens so you don't need to. Some people like to split up what funds are held where.

Regardless, sending tokens requires some ETH to cover the cost of gas. So having an account with *only* tokens isn't going to work.

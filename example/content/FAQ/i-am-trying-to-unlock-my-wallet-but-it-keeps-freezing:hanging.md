<p><span>Sorry you are having trouble. Decrypting the keystore files is an intensive process and doesn't enjoy being done in Javascript. We recommend...</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Using Google Chrome</span></li>
<li><span>Clicking "continue" when you see the unresponsive error alert pop up</span></li>
<li><span>Making sure you don't have other intensive programs open (a lot of browser tabs, video games, etc.)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The combination of the above typically eliminate the problem. If it doesn't, please contact us with your browser and OS and we can advise from there.</span></p>
